## About

> I'm a passionate Software Developer that loves anything that's technology. I love to to tinker and explore with different technologies, be it software or hardware.

I'm also a very efficient developer. Know why? Well, usually developers turn coffee into code, but I don't like coffee. So, I turn water into code  ;)
